Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis is essential for monitoring air quality and protecting public health. It provides a numerical measure of air quality based on pollutant concentrations, calculated using standardized formulas from environmental agencies. Data is gathered from monitoring stations, sensors, and satellites, then cleaned for accuracy. After calculating the AQI, visualizations like line charts and heatmaps illustrate trends and regional differences. Comparing AQI to air quality standards helps inform environmental policies and public health measures, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring to address pollution risks.
